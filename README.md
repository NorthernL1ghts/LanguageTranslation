# Language Translation Script

This is a simple Python script that uses the MyMemory translation API to translate text from English to a target language. It provides an easy way to translate text and save the translated output to a file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `requests` module installed. You can install it by running `pip install requests`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script using the command: `python LanguageTranslation.py`

4. The script will prompt you to enter the target language. For example, if you want to translate to French, enter `'fr'`. If you want to translate to Russian, enter `'ru'`, and so on.

5. Once you enter the target language, the script will read the text to be translated from the `data/input.txt` file. Make sure to provide the text you want to translate in this file before running the script.

6. The script will send a request to the MyMemory translation API, retrieve the translated text, and save it to the `out/output.txt` file.

7. After the translation is completed, you can check the `out` folder for the translated text.

8. The original text should be placed in the `data/input.txt` file, and the translated text will be saved to the `out/output.txt` file.

9. You can run the script multiple times to translate different texts or update the input file with new text.

Note: If the `data` and `out` directories or the input/output files do not exist, the script will create them automatically.

## Customize

If you want to modify the script or add more functionality, you can open the `LanguageTranslation.py` file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) and make the necessary changes. The script is well-commented to help you understand its structure and functions.

Feel free to adapt the script to fit your specific requirements or integrate it into your own projects.
